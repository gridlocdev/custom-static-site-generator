        <article id="ssg-inject-content"><h1 id="containers">Containers</h1>
<p><em>Containers</em> are lightweight portable environments that you create to run your software on.</p>
<p>A <em>container</em> is a program that runs application code in a secluded area of the operating system. Meaning, that program is completely isolated from and can't see anything in the rest of the processes on the machine.</p>
<p>Containers are just programs designed to run in an enclosed area with bound ports.</p>
<h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
<p>Virtualization is about abstracting the application and its components from the hardware that it runs on. <em>Containerization</em> is one main method of achieving this, while the other is using <em>Virtual Machines</em>.</p>
<p>Containers are different from <em>Virtual Machines</em> in that while Virtual Machines are a virtualized version of the entire operating system, containers just represent a sub-section of programs / files, and often times several containers are run inside one virtual machine.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks-of-traditional-bare-metal-hosting">Drawbacks of traditional bare-metal hosting</h2>
<p>Companies hosting their own bare-metal traditional server hosting typically presents a number of challenges for system admins and operations maintenance staff:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintenance costs</strong> : It often costs lots of money to purchase servers as well as to pay trained professionals to manage those servers.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling</strong> : Creating / allocating more computing power to handle increased traffic is often expensive and time-consuming as it means purchasing more servers and more work to configure network connectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Disaster recovery</strong> : The method and ability to revive the application back online in the event of an unpredictable outage like a cyber-attack, natural disaster, etc; can often result in loss of critical data / infrastructure, and cause lots of losses for a company.</li>
<li><strong>Environment Drift</strong> : Over time, individual tweaks and configuration fixes to servers, can cause unexpected bugs due to the differences in how things are implemented on one server vs another.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="container-options">Container Options</h2>
<p><strong>Docker</strong> is the leading industry tool used to manage individual containers.</p>
<p>There are a couple of notable alternative Container tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podman</li>
<li>LXC (Linux Containers)</li>
<li>Containerd</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="container-images">Container Images</h2>
<p>Containers run on an isolated filesystem, which the structure of what it looks like is set up using a <strong>container image</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>container image</strong> contains everything that is needed to run an application including:</p>
<ul>
<li>All dependencies</li>
<li>Configuration</li>
<li>Scripts</li>
<li>Binaries</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environment Variables</li>
<li>Default shell commands to run</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
